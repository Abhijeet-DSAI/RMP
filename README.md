# PathFinding-Visualizer Application:
Path finding algorithms plays a vital role in our daily life such as packets in computer networks , google maps uses a path finding algorthm to find the shortest path. So this project main idea is to visualize this path finding algorthms using react with the help of some css animations.




# Overview
This is a  project on visualizing path finding algorithms i.e BFS, DFS, Dikstra’s , Greedy search. Here path finded by path finding algorithms are denoted in yellow colour. This app is entirely built in react and below is the how the interface looks like. Here arrow Structure is Starting node and Circled Structure is the end node. You can see the various algorithms below to visualize.

## Breadth First Search
Breadth First Search explores equally in all directions.
This is an incredibly useful algorithm, not only for regular traversal, but also for procedural map generation, flow field pathfinding, distance maps, and other types of map analysis.
This may be the algorithm of choice to identify nearby places of interest in GPS.
BFS guarantees the shortest path. Below is the result for Breadth first search:

# Depth First Search
Traverses by exploring as far as possible down each path before backtracking.
As useful as the BFS: DFS can be used to generate a topological ordering, to generate mazes, to traverse trees, to build decision trees, to discover a solution path with hierarchical choices…
DFS does not guarantee the shortest path. Below is how the DFS works

# Dijkstra Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
We can assign lower cost to encourage moving on roads while assigning high cost on highway to avoid them.
It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations. Below is the demo:
